    - Develop a secure payment page integrated with Stripe Checkout
    - Implement subscription status tracking and user account locking mechanism
    - Send email notifications for subscription-related events using Resend

11. **Multi-tenancy**
    - Design a scalable tenant management system with a `tenant_id` column in all relevant tables
    - Implement robust data isolation between tenants using `tenant_id` as a mandatory filter in queries
    - Create tenant-specific configurations and customizations, storing them with associated `tenant_id`
    - Develop an efficient tenant onboarding process that initializes necessary `tenant_id` references
    - Optimize database queries for multi-tenant scenarios by including `tenant_id` in indexes and partitions
    - Implement tenant-specific email templates and configurations, linked to the appropriate `tenant_id`
    - Ensure all foreign key relationships include `tenant_id` to maintain data integrity within each tenant
    - Implement middleware to automatically inject `tenant_id` into all database operations
    - Design a system to handle cross-tenant operations securely when necessary
    - Implement robust error handling for cases where `tenant_id` might be missing or incorrect

12. **User Experience (UX) Design**
    - Implement progressive disclosure of complex features
    - Design intuitive navigation and information architecture
    - Create clear and concise error messages and help documentation
    - Implement user onboarding and feature tours
