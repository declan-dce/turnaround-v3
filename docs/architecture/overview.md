3. Multi-tenancy support with robust data isolation
4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and granular permission system
5. Subscription management with Stripe integration
6. Email service integration with Resend
7. Performance optimization through various techniques
8. Strong emphasis on code quality and maintainability

This architecture is designed to deliver a seamless, fast, and secure user experience while maintaining an efficient, clean codebase for developers, with a focus on server-side operations and minimal exposure of sensitive logic or data.
