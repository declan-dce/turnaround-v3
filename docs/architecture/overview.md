11. **String Constants**: Use centralized string constants for all labels, messages, and other text content

## String Constants Usage
Developers should always use constants for strings wherever possible.
This practice helps avoid manual updates of the same label or message in multiple areas of the codebase.
Here are some guidelines:

1. Store all string constants in a centralized location, such as a `constants` directory.
2. Organize constants into logical files (e.g., `generalStrings.ts`, `errorMessages.ts`, `labels.ts`).
3. Use descriptive names for constants to ensure clarity and ease of use.
4. Import and use these constants in components and functions instead of hardcoding strings.
5. For dynamic strings, use template literals with placeholders that can be filled at runtime.
6. Regularly review and update the constants to ensure they remain relevant and comprehensive.

## Data Flow
1. Client-side requests are handled by Next.js App Router
2. Server Components render content on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript
3. Server Actions handle data mutations and complex operations securely on the server
