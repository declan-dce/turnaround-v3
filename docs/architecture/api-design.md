# API Design

While our application primarily uses server functions, we still follow an API-First approach to ensure consistent and efficient development across the application.

## API-First Development Principles

1. Design Before Implementation
   - Create detailed specifications for server functions and data models before writing any code.
   - This approach ensures that all stakeholders agree on the design before development begins.

2. Version Control for Specifications
   - Maintain server function and data model specifications in version control alongside the codebase.
   - This allows for tracking changes and maintaining backward compatibility.

3. Use of Server Functions
   - Leverage Next.js Server Components and Server Actions for serverless backend functionality.
   - This approach provides a seamless integration between frontend and backend operations without exposing HTTP endpoints.

4. Efficient Data Operations
   - Design server functions to minimize data transfer and processing time.
   - Use appropriate error handling and status codes for different operations.

5. Consistent Error Handling
   - Define a standard error response format across all server functions.
   - Include meaningful error codes and messages to aid in debugging and improve user experience.

6. Authentication and Authorization
   - Implement robust authentication mechanisms for server function access.
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.

7. Documentation
   - Generate comprehensive documentation for server functions and data models.
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with each change or version update.

8. Versioning
   - Implement versioning for server functions to maintain backward compatibility.
   - Use clear version indicators in function names or parameters.

9. Rate Limiting and Throttling
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of server functions.
   - Use appropriate mechanisms to communicate rate limit information to clients.

10. Caching Strategy
    - Implement caching mechanisms to improve server function performance.
    - Use appropriate caching strategies for different types of data and operations.

11. Pagination
    - Implement pagination for server functions that return large datasets.
    - Use consistent pagination parameters across all relevant functions.

By following these design principles, we ensure a consistent, efficient, and developer-friendly approach across our application, prioritizing server functions while maintaining an API-first methodology.
